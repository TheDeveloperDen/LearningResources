# Automating Workflows with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions allow you to automate various tasks, from building and testing code to deploying applications. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create workflows to streamline your development process.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of GitHub Actions.
- Learn how to create and configure workflows.
- Explore common actions and workflow triggers.
- Master the process of creating custom actions.

## What are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions are automated workflows that you define in your repository. They can run tasks based on events like pushes, pull requests, or scheduled intervals.

## Creating a Workflow

1. **Workflow File**: Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository. Inside it, create a YAML file (e.g., `main.yml`) for your workflow.

2. **Workflow Structure**: Define jobs, steps, and actions in the YAML file to specify the tasks you want to automate.

3. **Workflow Triggers**: Specify the events that trigger your workflow, such as `push` or `pull_request`.

## Common Actions

GitHub Actions provides a marketplace of pre-built actions for various tasks.

- `actions/setup-node`: Set up Node.js environment.
- `actions/checkout`: Check out your repository code.
- `actions/run`: Run shell commands in your workflow.

## Creating Custom Actions

You can also create your own custom actions for specific tasks.

- Define the action in a separate repository.
- Use Docker containers or JavaScript for the action's execution.

## Workflow Examples

- Build and Test: Automate building and testing your code on every push.
- Deploy to Production: Automatically deploy your application when changes are merged to the `main` branch.

## Next Steps

You've learned how to use GitHub Actions for automation. In the next tutorial, we'll explore collaboration in larger teams.
