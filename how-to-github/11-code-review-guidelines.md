- Master the process of approving and merging pull requests.

## Why Code Reviews?

Code reviews help catch bugs, improve code quality, and ensure consistency in the codebase.

## Conducting Effective Code Reviews

1. **Review the Code**: Carefully review the changes, focusing on functionality, logic, and style.

2. **Provide Feedback**: Use comments to provide feedback on specific lines of code or overall design.

3. **Be Constructive**: Frame feedback in a constructive and respectful manner.

## Code Review Best Practices

- **Focus on Logic**: Ensure the code logic is correct and meets the requirements.
- **Style Consistency**: Check for consistent coding style and adherence to coding standards.
- **Testing**: Verify that the code includes appropriate tests for new functionality.

## Approving and Merging Pull Requests

- **Approval**: Approve the pull request if you're satisfied with the changes.
- **Merge**: Merge the pull request once it's approved and passes automated tests.

## Collaborative Code Review

- **Multiple Reviewers**: Involve multiple team members for diverse feedback.
- **Discussion**: Engage in discussions to clarify doubts and address concerns.
