## What are GitHub Issues?

Issues are a way to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs for a repository. They provide a platform for discussion and collaboration.

## Creating and Managing Issues

1. **Creating an Issue**: Click on "Issues" in the repository and then "New Issue." Provide a clear title and description.

2. **Adding Labels**: Labels categorize issues (e.g., bug, enhancement). They help with organization and prioritization.

3. **Assigning and Mentioning**: Assign issues to specific users and mention team members using "@username."

## Using Milestones

Milestones group related issues together. They help track progress toward specific goals or releases.

- Create Milestone: Click "Milestones" in the repository and then "New Milestone."
- Assigning Issues: Associate issues with a milestone to track progress.

## Closing Issues

- Close Manually: Manually close an issue by clicking "Close Issue" when the task is completed.

## Referencing Issues

You can reference issues in commits and pull requests using keywords like "fixes," "closes," or "resolves."

- Example: "Fixes #123: Fixed a critical bug."
