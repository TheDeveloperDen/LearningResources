# Different Merge Strategies

Merging changes from one branch into another is a common task in Git. In this tutorial, you'll learn about various merge strategies and when to use them.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of merge strategies.
- Learn about different merge strategies available in Git.
- Explore scenarios for choosing the appropriate merge strategy.

## What are Merge Strategies?

Merge strategies determine how Git combines changes from different branches.

## Different Merge Strategies

### 1. Fast-Forward Merge

- **Description**: When the target branch's history hasn't diverged since the source branch was created.
- **Usage**: Suitable for feature branches that are merged into the main branch.
- **Command**: `git merge <source-branch>`

### 2. Recursive Merge

- **Description**: Incorporates changes from multiple branches with a common ancestor.
- **Usage**: Used for more complex scenarios where fast-forward isn't possible.
- **Command**: `git merge --no-ff <source-branch>`

### 3. Squash Merge

- **Description**: Combines all commits in the source branch into a single commit in the target branch.
- **Usage**: Creates a cleaner commit history when merging feature branches.
- **Command**: `git merge --squash <source-branch>`.

### 4. Merge Commit

- **Description**: Creates a new merge commit that records the merge operation.
- **Usage**: Keeps a clear record of when and why changes were merged.
- **Command**: `git merge --no-ff -m "Merge message" <source-branch>`.

## Choosing the Right Merge Strategy

- **Fast-Forward**: Use when the branches have a linear history and fast-forwarding is possible.
- **Recursive**: Use when merging branches with complex changes and diverged histories.
- **Squash**: Use when you want a clean commit history for feature branches.
- **Merge Commit**: Use when preserving the individual commits' context is important.
