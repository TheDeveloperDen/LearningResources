# Exploring GitHub's REST API

GitHub's REST API provides a traditional way to interact with GitHub repositories and resources. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use GitHub's REST API to retrieve and manage data.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of RESTful APIs and how GitHub's REST API works.
- Learn how to make requests to GitHub's REST API.
- Explore retrieving specific data using REST endpoints.
- Master the process of integrating REST API calls in your projects.

## What is a REST API?

A RESTful API allows you to interact with resources using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

## Making Requests

1. **Endpoint URL**: Use the appropriate endpoint URL to access the desired resource.

2. **HTTP Methods**: Use HTTP methods to interact with resources (e.g., GET to retrieve data, POST to create resources).

## Retrieving Specific Data

- **Query Parameters**: Use query parameters to customize the data you retrieve.
- **Authentication**: Authenticate your requests using a personal access token.

## Using GitHub's REST API

- **Accessing Repository Data**: Retrieve repository information, issues, pull requests, and more.
- **Authentication**: Generate a personal access token for API authentication.

## Request Examples

- **Fetching Repository Information**:
  ```http
  GET /repos/:owner/:repo
  ```
 - Creating an issue
```http
POST /repos/:owner/:repo/issues
{
  "title": "New Issue",
  "body": "This is a new issue."
}
```
