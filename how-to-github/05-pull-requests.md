# Collaborative Development with Pull Requests

Pull requests are a fundamental aspect of collaboration on GitHub. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use pull requests to propose, review, and merge changes.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the purpose of pull requests.
- Learn how to create a pull request.
- Explore code review and collaboration using pull requests.
- Master the process of merging pull requests.

## What is a Pull Request?

A pull request (PR) is a way to propose changes from a forked repository to the original repository. It allows for discussion, feedback, and code review before merging.

## Creating a Pull Request

1. **Fork the Repository**: Go to the repository you want to contribute to and click "Fork" to create a copy in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone and Create Branch**: Clone your forked repository and create a new branch for your changes.

3. **Make Changes**: Commit and push your changes to your branch.

4. **Create Pull Request**: Go to the original repository and click "New Pull Request." Compare your branch and create the pull request.

## Code Review and Collaboration

- Comment on Specific Lines: Use the GitHub interface to leave comments on specific lines of code.
- Address Feedback: Respond to comments, make necessary changes, and push updates to the same branch.

## Merging Pull Requests

- Merge Automatically: For small changes, you can merge directly from the GitHub interface.
- Merge with Review: For larger changes, follow a code review process before merging.

## Next Steps

You've learned how to use pull requests for collaborative development. In the next tutorial, we'll explore issue tracking and management.
