## What this is 

idk

## How to contribute

Simply make a PR and submit it!

### Guidelines
- Keep the pros and cons section as objective as possible
- Prices should be in US Dollars (eg `19.99`)
- Keep the descriptions for topics concise
- For more abstract concepts, try and keep them generic rather than for a specific language.
For example, "Dependency Injection" rather than "Dependency Injection in Java". You can then include
more specific resources
- Name JSON files in `lower_snake_case`
